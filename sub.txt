ceasar:
To encrypt a message with a Caesar cipher, each letter in the message is changed 
using a simple rule: shift by three. Each letter is replaced by the letter three letters ahead in 
the alphabet. A becomes D, B becomes E, and so on. For the last letters, we can think of 
alphabet as a circle and "wrap around". W becomes Z, X becomes A, Y becomes B, and Z 
becomes C. To change a message back, each letter is replaced by the one three before it.

brute force:
We can hack the Caesar cipher by using a cryptanalytic technique called brute-force. 
A brute-force attack tries every possible decryption key for a cipher. Decrypting the 
ciphertext with that key, looking at the output, and then moving on to the next key if they 
didn’t find the secret message. Because the brute-force technique is so effective against the 
Caesar cipher

railfence:
In the rail fence cipher, the plain text is written downwards and diagonally on successive 
"rails" of an imaginary fence, then moving up when we reach the bottom rail. When we 
reach the top rail, the message is written downwards again until the whole plaintext is 
written out. The message is then read off in rows.

product:
In cryptography, a product cipher combines two or more transformations in a manner 
intending that the resulting cipher is more secure than the individual components to make it 
resistant to cryptanalysis. The product cipher combines a sequence of simple 
transformations such

AES:
AES is an iterative rather than Feistel cipher. It is based on ‘substitution–permutation 
network’. It comprises of a series of linked operations, some of which involve replacing 
inputs by specific outputs (substitutions) and others involve shuffling bits around 
(permutations). 
Interestingly, AES performs all its computations on bytes rather than bits. Hence, AES treats 
the 128 bits of a plaintext block as 16 bytes. These 16 bytes are arranged in four columns 
and four rows for processing as a matrix.

2. Cipher Block Chain Mode 
3. Output feedback block Mode

5. Counter Mode 

Electronic Code Block Mode: 
Electronic code book is the easiest block cipher mode of functioning. It is easier because 
of direct encryption of each block of input plaintext and output is in form of blocks of 
encrypted cipher text. Generally, if a message is larger than b bits in size, it can be broken 
down into a bunch of blocks and the procedure is repeated. 

Cipher Block Chain Mode: 
Cipher block chaining or CBC is an advancement made on ECB since ECB compromises 
some security requirements. In CBC, the previous cipher block is given as input to the next 
encryption algorithm after XOR with the original plaintext block. In a nutshell here, a 
cipher block is produced by encrypting an XOR output of the previous cipher block and 
present plaintext block.

Perform AES in OFB, CFB and Counter Modes
Open SSL is an all-around cryptography library that offers an open-source 
application of the TLS protocol. First released in 1998, it is available for Linux, Windows, 
macOS, and BSD systems. OpenSSL allows users to perform various SSL-related tasks, 
including CSR (Certificate Signing Request) and private keys generation, and SSL 
certificate installation, encryption and decryption in different modes and algorithms.

Digital Signature 
A digital signature is an electronic, encrypted, stamp of authentication on digital 
information such as email messages, macros, or electronic documents. A signature 
confirms that the information originated from the signer and has not been altered.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RSA 
Asymmetric encryption involves a mechanism called Public Key and Private 
Key. Everyone in the network can access the public key but the private key is anonymous. 
The user generates a private key using a function. 
• To encrypt a message, one can use the public key. 
• Send the message over a channel. The private key is generated on the receiver side. 
• The private key is used to decrypt the encrypted message. 
The Rivest-Shamir-Adleman(RSA) Algorithm is a public-key crypto algorithm. It is based 
on the principle that prime factorization of a large composite number is tough. Only the 
private key of the receiver can decrypt the cipher message. RSA is a key pair generator.

Hashing Techniques SHA -256 and SHA 512 
Hashing is the process of translating a given key into a code. A hash function is used 
to substitute the information with a newly generated hash code. More specifically, 
hashing is the practice of taking a string or input key, a variable created for storing 
narrative data, and representing it with a hash value, which is typically determined by 
an algorithm and constitutes a much shorter string than the original. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implementation of Digital Certificates 
A digital certificate is a file or electronic password that proves the authenticity of a 
device, server, or user through the use of cryptography and the public key 
infrastructure (PKI). 
Digital certificate authentication helps organizations ensure that only trusted devices 
and users can connect to their networks. Another common use of digital certificates is 
to confirm the authenticity of a website to a web browser, which is also known as a 
secure sockets layer or SSL certificate. 
A digital certificate contains identifiable information, such as a user’s name, company, 
or department and a device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address or serial number. Digital 
certificates contain a copy of a public key from the certificate holder, which needs to 
be matched to a corresponding private key to verify it is real. A public key certificate 
is issued by certificate authorities (CAs), which sign certificates to verify the identity 
of the requesting device or user.

wireshark
Wireshark, a network analysis tool formerly known as Ethereal, captures 
packets in real time and display them in human-readable format. Wireshark 
includes filters, color-coding and other features that let you dig deep into 
network traffic and inspect individual packets. 
Applications: 
• Network administrators use it to troubleshoot network problems 
• Network security engineers use it to examine security problems 
• Developers use it to debug protocol implementations 
• People use it to learn network protocol internals beside these examples 
can be helpful in many other situations too. 
Features: 
The following are some of the many features wireshark provides: 
• Available for UNIX and Windows. 
• Capture live packet data from a network interface. 
• Open files containing packet data captured with tcpdump/WinDump, 
Wireshark, 
• and a number of other packet capture programs. 
• Import packets from text files containing hex dumps of packet data. 
• Display packets with very detailed protocol information. 
• Export some or all packets in a number of capture file formats. 
• Filter packets on many criteria. 
• Search for packets on many criteria. 
• Colorize packet display based on filters. 
• Create various statistics.

keylogger
The term ‘keylogger’ itself is neutral, and the word describes the program’s 
function. Most sources define a keylogger as a software program designed to 
secretly monitor and log all keystrokes. This definition is not altogether correct, 
since a keylogger doesn’t have to be software – it can also be a device. 
Keylogging devices are much rarer than keylogging software, but it is important 
to keep their existence in mind when thinking about information security. 
Legitimate programs may have a keylogging function which can be used to call 
certain program functions using “hotkeys,” or to toggle between keyboard layouts 
(e.g. Keyboard Ninja). There is a lot of legitimate software which is designed to 
allow administrators to track what employees do throughout the day, or to allow 
users to track the activity of third parties on their computers. However, the ethical 
boundary between justified monitoring and espionage is a fine line. Legitimate 
software is often used deliberately to steal confidential user information such as 
passwords.

email
PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) which is invented by Phil 
Zimmermann. 
• PGP was designed to provide all four aspects of security, i.e., privacy, 
integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation in the sending of email. 
• PGP uses a digital signature (a combination of hashing and public key 
encryption) to provide integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation. PGP 
uses a combination of secret key encryption and public key encryption to 
provide privacy. Therefore, we can say that the digital signature uses one 
hash function, one secret key, and two private-public key pairs. 
• PGP is an open source and freely available software package for email 
security. 
• PGP provides authentication through the use of Digital Signature. 
• It provides confidentiality through the use of symmetric block encryption. 

Analyze the Phishing Attack 
Theory:  
An email phishing attack is a form of cybercrime where attackers send 
fraudulent emails that appear to be from legitimate sources, such as banks, 
companies, or trusted individuals, to deceive recipients into disclosing sensitive 
information or performing actions that compromise their security. These emails 
are designed to look convincing and often contain urgent or enticing messages, 
fake links, or malicious attachments intended to trick recipients into clicking on 
links, downloading files, or providing personal information like passwords, 
credit card numbers, or social security numbers. The goal of an email phishing 
attack is to exploit the victim's trust to gain unauthorized access to sensitive 
data or systems.
